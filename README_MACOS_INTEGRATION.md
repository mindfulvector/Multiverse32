# macOS Integration for Multiverse32

This document describes the macOS integration improvements made to the Win32 Hello World cross-platform application.

## Problem
The original application had the following issues on macOS:
- Window appeared behind the terminal when launched
- No dock icon
- No menu bar
- Not recognized as a proper macOS application

## Solution
The following changes were made to provide proper macOS integration:

### 1. App Bundle Structure
- Created proper macOS app bundle with `MACOSX_BUNDLE TRUE` in CMakeLists.txt
- Added Info.plist with proper bundle configuration
- Set bundle identifier: `com.multiverse.win32hello`
- Set display name: `Multiverse32`

### 2. Custom Icon
- Created a unique "Multiverse32" icon with cosmic/multiverse theme
- Generated proper .icns file with all required resolutions (16x16 to 1024x1024)
- Integrated icon into app bundle

### 3. Menu Bar Integration
- Added `SetupMacOSMenuBar()` function to create proper macOS menu structure
- Application menu with About, Services, Hide/Show, and Quit options
- Window menu with Minimize, Zoom, and window management options
- Proper keyboard shortcuts (⌘Q for quit, ⌘M for minimize, etc.)

### 4. Application Lifecycle
- Set `NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular` to show in dock
- Added `[NSApp finishLaunching]` for proper initialization
- Added `[NSApp activateIgnoringOtherApps:YES]` to bring window to front
- Proper Objective-C memory management with ARC

### 5. Build System
- Updated CMakeLists.txt for macOS app bundle creation
- Automatic copying of icon and Info.plist to bundle
- Proper Objective-C++ compilation flags

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `Resources/Info.plist` - macOS app bundle configuration
- `Resources/Multiverse32.icns` - Application icon
- `create_icon.sh` - Script to generate icon from SVG
- `run_app.sh` - Build and run script

### Modified Files:
- `win32_compat.h` - Fixed BOOL type conflicts with Objective-C
- `win32_hello.cpp` - Added macOS menu bar and proper app integration
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Added macOS app bundle configuration

## Usage

### Building and Running:
```bash
# Build and run the application
./run_app.sh

# Or manually:
cmake -B build
make -C build
open build/Win32HelloWorld.app
```

### Features:
